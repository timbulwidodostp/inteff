where {it:varlist} must be the same as the fitted logit or probit model
and must include at least four variables. The order of these first four
variables must be dependent variable, independent variable 1, independent
variable 2, and the interaction between independent variables 1 and 2. Other
independent variables can be added after the interaction term, i.e., starting
from the fifth position.

{p 8 8 2}
If the interaction term (at the fourth position) is a product of a
continuous variable and a dummy variable, the first independent
variable x_1 has to be the continuous variable, and the second independent
variable x_2 has to be the dummy variable. The order of the second and
third variables does not matter if both are continuous or both are dummy
variables.


{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
The new command {cmd:inteff} calculates the interaction effect, standard
error, and {it:z}-statistic for each observation for either logit or probit
when two variables have been interacted. The interacted variables cannot
have higher order terms, such as squared terms. The command is designed to
be run immediately after fitting a logit or probit model.

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:savedata(}{it:filename}[{cmd:, replace}]{cmd:)} specifies the path
and filename of computed data to be saved. This gives the researcher the
option of further investigation. Saved data include five variables, in the
following order:

{p 12 15 2}1. predicted probability{p_end}
{p 12 15 2}2. interaction effect (calculated by conventional linear
method){p_end}
{p 12 15 2}3. interaction effect (calculated by the method suggested in this
paper){p_end}
{p 12 15 2}4. standard error of the interaction effect{p_end}
{p 12 15 2}5. {it:z}-statistic of the interaction effect{p_end}

{p 8 8 2}
The variables all have meaningful names. For example,
after we run a logit model, the five variables would be {cmd:_logit_phat},
{cmd:_logit_linear}, {cmd:_logit_ie}, {cmd:_logit_se}, and 
{cmd:_logit_z}. The prefix for probit models is {cmd:_probit}.

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:savegraph1(}{it:filename}[{cmd:, replace}]{cmd:)} and
{cmd:savegraph2(}{it:filename}[{cmd:, replace}]{cmd:)} save the graphs
with the name and path designated by the user.  The {cmd:inteff} command
generates two scatter graphs. Both plot predicted probabilities on the
{it:x}-axis. The first graph plots two interaction effects (one is calculated
by the method suggested in this paper, and the other one is calculated by the
conventional linear method) against predicted probabilities. The second graph
plots z-statistics of the interaction effect against predicted
probabilities.
